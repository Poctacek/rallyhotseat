## 📌 Overview

Rally Hot-Seat Web allows you to:

- Add multiple drivers
- Create rally rounds (stage + car)
- Enter stage times in `MM:SS:MMM` format
- Automatically calculate differences
- Display final overall results
- Continue the race or start a new one

Everything runs fully client-side — no backend required.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Add your drivers  
2. Start a round (enter stage name + car)  
3. Input times in format: `00:00:000`
4. Finish the round
5. Repeat for all stages
6. Click **Finish Race** to see your final standings

A modal will display final times and time gaps

## 🚫 DSQ Handling

- `DSQ` is currently treated as **15:00:000**
- You cannot DSQ all drivers (race cannot finish)
- Temporary workaround: Instead of typing `DSQ`, enter: `15:00:000`

(Custom DSQ logic is planned for future updates.)
